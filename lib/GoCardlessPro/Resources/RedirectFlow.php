/**
  * Redirect flows enable you to use GoCardless Pro's [hosted payment
  * pages](https://pay-sandbox.gocardless.com/AL000000AKFPFF) to set up mandates
  * with your customers. These pages are fully compliant and have been
  * translated into Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
  *
  * 
  * The overall flow is:
  * 
  * 1. You [create](#create-a-redirect-flow)
  * a redirect flow for your customer, and redirect them to the returned
  * redirect url, e.g. `https://pay.gocardless.com/flow/RE123`.
  * 
  * 2. Your
  * customer supplies their name, email, address, and bank account details, and
  * submits the form. This securely stores their details, and redirects them
  * back to your `success_redirect_url` with `redirect_flow_id=RE123` in the
  * querystring.
  * 
  * 3. You [complete](#complete-a-redirect-flow) the
  * redirect flow, which creates a [customer](#core-endpoints-customers),
  * [customer bank account](#core-endpoints-customer-bank-accounts), and
  * [mandate](#core-endpoints-mandates), and returns the ID of the mandate. You
  * may wish to create a [subscription](#core-endpoints-subscriptions) or
  * [payment](#core-endpoints-payments) at this point.
  * 
  * It is
  * recommended that you link the redirect flow to your user object as soon as
  * it is created, and attach the created resources to that user in the complete
  * step.
  * 
  * Redirect flows expire 30 minutes after they are first
  * created. You cannot complete an expired redirect flow.
