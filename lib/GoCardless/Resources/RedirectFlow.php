/**
  * Redirect flows enable you to use GoCardless Pro's secure payment pages to
  * set up mandates with your customers.
  * 
  * The overall flow is:
  * 
  *
  * 1. You
  * [create](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#create-a-redirect-flow) a
  * redirect flow for your customer, and redirect them to the returned redirect
  * url, e.g. `https://pay.gocardless.com/flow/RE123`.
  * 
  * 2. Your customer
  * supplies their name, email, address, and bank account details, and submits
  * the form. This securely stores their details, and redirects them back to
  * your `success_redirect_url` with `redirect_flow_id=RE123` in the
  * querystring.
  * 
  * 3. You
  * [complete](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#complete-a-redirect-flow)
  * the redirect flow, which creates a
  * [customer](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-customers),
  * [customer bank
  * account](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-customer-bank-accounts),
  * and [mandate](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-mandates),
  * and returns the ID of the mandate. You may wish to create a
  * [subscription](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-subscriptions)
  * or [payment](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#api-endpoints-payments)
  * at this point.
  * 
  * It is recommended that you link the redirect flow to
  * your user object as soon as it is created, and attach the created resources
  * to that user in the complete step.
  * 
  * Redirect flows expire 30 minutes
  * after they are first created. You cannot
  * [complete](https://developer.gocardless.com/pro/#complete-a-redirect-flow)
  * an expired redirect flow.
